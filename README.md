# Pokémon Emerald Rom hack
Basic changes for a more interesting nuzlocke

## Added Features
- max item qty increased to 999 in bag
- start with 999 rare candies
- text speed set to fast by default
- options menu is now scrolable with more nuzlocke specific settings
- added option for random encounters
    - on: all encounters will be randomly selected at battle time
    - seeded: all wild encounters will have their pokemon species offset by a seeded random number  
    meaning that each route will still have fixed pokemon avalable but they will be randomly offset from the defaults
- added option for random trainers
    - on: trainers mons will be randomly generated each time you battle them
    - seeded: trainer mons will be generated based on a seed, they will be random to each playthrough but consistent between battles
- added option for random starters
    - this option must be selected from the options menu befor picking your starter mon... obviously
- you are forced into the nickname screen on captuning a mon
    - you can still skip this by exiting the screen without setting a name

## Wishlist
- [ ] don't let rare candies level you up higher than the highest pokemon you have defeated
- [ ] add an indicator to show if you have had your encounter in the current map

## under consideration
- [ ] auto move pokemon to the box when they die
- [ ] add uber repels that last longer
- [ ] limit water pokemon to fishing encounters... maybe

## known issues
- [ ] instant text speed option breaks text engine
- [ ] there are some edge cases where the options meun scroll gets wonky, still works tho
