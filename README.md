# Pokémon Emerald Rom hack
Basic changes for a more interesting nuzlocke

- start with 999 rare candies in the box
- text speed set to fast by default
- added option for random encounters/starters
    - this does not effect trainer battles, only wild encounters

This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald.

## Wishlist
- [ ] update the bag to have stacks of 999
- [ ] include trainer/gyms in the random pokemon option
- [ ] add uber repels that last longer
- [ ] force player to name all pokemon
- [ ] auto move pokemon to the box when they die
- [ ] add an indicator to show if you have had your encounter in the current map
- [ ] limit water pokemon to fishing encounters... maybe
- [ ] fix the instant text speed setting
- [ ] update settings page to have more nuzlocke specific settings
- [ ] update settings page to be scrollable for more settings
- [ ] don't let rare candies level you up higher than the highest pokemon you have defeated
- [ ] limit each route to only a few species
